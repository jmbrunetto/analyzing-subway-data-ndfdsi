# Project: Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset

Data science project provided by Udacity as part of Data Scientist NanoDegree.

## What's included?

The project is divided in three parts:
* Data collect (python, http request, pandas);
* Data analysis (pandasql, matplotlib, numpy);
* Data processing (MapReduce);

## Resume

This project is oriented to apply the techniques learned in section BigData and MapReduce of Nanodegree Data Scientist.
Here I'm going to analyze the NY subway data and discovery information about the subway use on rainy days.
I'll cross the NY data with the weather data and apply statistic methods to help visualize the insights found.

* Install [Anaconda Scientific Python]()

You can see the final result [here]()
